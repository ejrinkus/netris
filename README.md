Netris
======

Netris is the future.  A brotastic retro-future where tetris may now be played over a network (hopefully).

WARNING:  This game may cause massive amounts of facemelting.  And this readme may be a bit of an exaggeration...

Version History
===============
0.1 Basic game - no menu, score, or round counter, one speed.  Only has basic controls (shift left/right, drop fast, drop instant, and rotate clockwise), and shows the next piece.  Completed lines disappear, blocks properly stack, game exits when top boundary is breached.
